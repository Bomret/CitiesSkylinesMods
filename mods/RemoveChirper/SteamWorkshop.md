[h1]Remove Chirper[/h1]
Removes Chirper from the game as long as you are subscribed to this mod. There were older mods like this one but they were either abandoned or didn't work with the current version of the game anymore. So I quickly created my own version.

This mod also does not only hide the Chirper but completely disables it using the game's API.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
[b]Game Version[/b]: 1.19.2-f3
[b]Uses Harmony[/b]: no
[b]Changes Save Files[/b]: no

Fully compatible with the following mods that provide similar functionality:

- Hide It!

Should be compatible with any other mod.
