[h1]Natural Lighting[/h1]
This mod is a "no-frills", "no performance impact", "no configuration needed" attempt to provide an instant visual improvement in the game by making the in-game lighting look more natural and the shadows on the buildings less harsh.

It is targeted at users of Daylight Classic and Softer Shadows but made for the current version of the game (1.17.1-f4) and having some of the features removed that targeted the version of the game available in their day and age that work a bit janky in the current version or look out of place nowadays (in my opinion).

The mods provides translations for all it's options menu items in all the languages supported by the game. If you find an incorrect translation, please leave a comment below or open an issue on GitHub, linked below.

[h2]Natural Lighting LUT[/h2]
I created a dedicated Natural Lighting LUT that goes very well with this mod but can also be used without it. All the screenshots you see above were made having that LUT enabled.

But you can of course any other LUT you like.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
[b]Game Version[/b]: 1.17.1-f4

This mod has a built-in check for the presence of the following mods that provide similar functionality or would break it:
[list]
    [*]Daylight Classic
    [*]Softer Shadows
    [*]Render It!
    [*]Lumina
[/list]
If one of these is detected, Natural Lighting will disable itself and show a message in it's settings panel in the game's options menu. You have to deactivate these other mods in order to use Natural Lighting.

[h2]Why not just use Render It! or Lumina?[/h2]
I like both mods. I used them for quite some time as Daylight Classic and Softer Shadows are very old and have their quirks with the current version of the game. But I could never get exactly the look I wanted and both mods mods gave me option paralysis. I just wanted a no-config, instant improvement for the game's very yellow tinted lighting. So I created Natural Lighting for myself and decided to share it here.
