# Cities Skylines Mods

[![Test](https://github.com/Bomret/CitiesSkylinesMods/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Bomret/CitiesSkylinesMods/actions/workflows/test.yml)

This is a monorepo containing the source code for all my mods and their dependencies for the game Cities: Skylines by Colossal Order.

Currently available mods:
- [Remove Chirper](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3134254484): Removes Chirper from the game (the chatty blue bird that displays messages from your citizens).
- [Remove Advisor](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3138620643) (⚠️ Currently out of order because of some unexpected side effects): Removes the in-game advisor from the game (the "?" button and it's tutorial messages).
- Natural Lighting: adjusts in-game lighting to look more natural.
